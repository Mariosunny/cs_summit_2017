Text similarity programs can used to determine the author of an unknown text based upon identifiable patterns in the text. 


determine authorship of . Text mining is used in several English-related applications. 

In 2013, a professor at Duquesne University used an text similarity program to uncover the true identity of the author of the crime fiction novel, The Cuckoo's Calling. It was none other than J.K. Rowling, who had been writing under the psuedonoynm Robert Galbraith.

Text similarity algorithms have been used to detect plagarism in academic work. Software tools such as Turnitin and SafeAssign help instructors automatically identify cheaters.

Text similiarity algorithms can be very complex, involving numerous advanced mathematical calculations. Today, we'll be creating a simple algorithm based upon word frequency to determine the similiarity between several pairs of text.

In the BLOB language, there is one primitive data type: string. Strings are sequences of characters that encapsulate numbers, text, or regular expressions. Strings have zero-based numbering.



A "second" primitive data type, null, is defined as the empty string (""). 



There is one data structure- the collection. Collections are a set of key-value pairs, where keys are unique strings and values are strings or collections. Internally, collections are implemented as associative arrays, but may also be treated as ordered arrays or sets. Like strings, collections have zero-based numbering.

Define x as ["a", "b", "c"]

{
"0": "a",
"1": "b",
"2": "c"
}



BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS

apply(string, function)

reduce(string, function)


range(size)
Returns an array of consequetive integers, beginning from zero and ending at size - 1.

range(4) -> [0, 1, 2, 3]


range(start, end, increment="1")
Returns an array of integers, beginning from start and ending at end - 1, with the specified increment.

range(1, 6, 2) -> [1, 3, 5]


split(string, separator=" ")
Splits the string according to a separator string, and returns the resulting array.

Set x as "a bc def"
split(x) -> ["a", "bc", "def"]
split(x, "") -> ["a", " ", "b", "c", " ", "d", "e", "f"]

length(string)
Returns the number of characters in the string.

Define x as "hello"
length(x) -> 5


length(collection)
Returns the number of key-value pairs in the collection.

Define x as [2, "5", 4]
length(x) -> 3


indexOf(string, searchString)
Returns null ("") if no match is found.


match(string, searchString)
Returns a collection of , where each key 



Set x to "abba bab bbab bab"
match(x, "bab") -> {"5": "bab", "10": "bab", "14": "bab"}


charAt(string, index)
Returns a string of the character at .

concat(string1, string2)
Combines two strings into a one string. Equivalent to the '+' non-numeric string concatenation operator.

concat(array1, array2)
Combines two collections into a single collection, treating each collection as an ordered array. The key in each key-value pair in the second collection is increased by the size of the first collection, effectively preserving the order of each array. Equivalent to the '+' array concatenation operator.

update(collection1, collection2)
Combines two collections into a single collection, treating each collection as an associative array. 



Eqivalent to the '+' associative array concatenation operator.


includes(string, searchString)
Returns 1 if the string contains the search string, 0 otherwise.

includes(collection, object)
Returns 1 if the collection contains the object as one of its values, 0 otherwise.

containsKey(collection, string)
Returns 1 if the collection contains the specified key


equals(string1, string2)
Returns 1 if the two strings are exactly equal, 0 otherwise. Case sensitive. 
Equivalent to the '==' string comparison operator.

equalsIgnoreCase(string1, string2)
Returns 1 if the two strings are exactly equal, 0 otherwise. Case insensitive. 
Equivalent to the '==' string comparison operator.

equals(collection1, collection2)
Equivalent to the '==' collection comparison operator.

sort(array, function="")
Returns the array, sorted in ascending order as defined by the function. The function should take two parameters and return 1 if the first parameter is greater than the second, 0 if they are equal, and -1 if the first parameter is less than the second. If no function is specified, the array is sorted by its natural order.

Set x as ["wood", "stone", "gold"]
sort(x) -> ["gold", "stone", "wood"]

shuffle(array)
Returns the array, shuffled randomly.

Set x as ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
shuffle(x) -> ["b", "c", "d", "a"]
