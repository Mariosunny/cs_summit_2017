Text similarity programs can used to determine the author of an unknown text based upon identifiable patterns in the text. 


determine authorship of . Text mining is used in several English-related applications. 

In 2013, a professor at Duquesne University used an text similarity program to uncover the true identity of the author of the crime fiction novel, The Cuckoo's Calling. It was none other than J.K. Rowling, who had been writing under the psuedonoynm Robert Galbraith.

Text similarity algorithms have been used to detect plagarism in academic work. Software tools such as Turnitin and SafeAssign help instructors automatically identify cheaters.

Text similiarity algorithms can be very complex, involving numerous advanced mathematical calculations. Today, we'll be creating a simple algorithm based upon word frequency to determine the similiarity between several pairs of text. 



- Drink water from [nearest water source, farthest water source, most abundant water source, safest water source, least crowded water source, most crowded water source]
- Eat food from [nearest food source, farthest food source, most abundant food source, safest food source, least crowded food source, most crowded food source]
